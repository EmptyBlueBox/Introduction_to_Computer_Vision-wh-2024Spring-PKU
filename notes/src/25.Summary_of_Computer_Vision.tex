\section{Summary of Computer Vision}

Compared to human vision, computer vision deals with the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item visual data acquisition (similar to human eyes but comes withmany more choices)
    \item image processing and feature extraction (mostly low-level)
    \item analyze local structures and then 3D reconstruct the original scene (from mid-level to high-level)
    \item understanding (mostly high-level)
    \item generation (beyond the scope of human vision system)
    \item and further serving embodied agents to make decisions and take actions.
\end{enumerate}
